This README file will include the purpose, the design of the app, how the app works, and the utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions.

THE PURPOSE:
Planning meals can be very stressful, especially for the people with busy schedules, which is why this app is convenient. The purpose of the Meal Recommendation App is to guide users in deciding meals according to the time of day. The app allows users to enter the current time and get meal recommendations based on particular times of the day the user inputs. The app makes it easier for the user by saving time in deciding on what to cook and reduces the stress of meal planning, it is also helpful in terms of the user discovering new meals to try out.

THE DESIGN OF THE APP:
The user interface is designed in a way that is creative and is simple to use, the user interface is designed in LinearLayout which makes the homescreen clear, neat and arranges the TextView, EditText and Buttons in a straight and centered format. There are 3 buttons which are the Recommend, Reset and Dismiss buttons. The recommend button will show a meal, the Reset button will clear the output and the text and the Dismiss button will exit the application. The app also includes a TOAST which is simply a pop-up text to show that you have successfully reset the output and the text. 

HOW THE APP WORKS:
The app works very easily all you need to do is:
*You have to input the current time of the day 
*Press the recommend button  
*The app will then automatically recommend a meal for that specific time of day the user has entered

Then you will dismiss the app once you have got the recommendation for the meal of the given time of day.

UTILIZATION OF GITHUB AND GITHUB ACTIONS:


By providing a specific meal suggestion based on the time of day, the Meal Recommendation App is designed to reduce the difficulties related to meal planning, and reduces food waste.
